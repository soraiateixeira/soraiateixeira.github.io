                <p class="description">The “boxes” are three storage boxes that call the contact between the user and the lid of these pieces. To open each object, whoever uses them needs to exert some form on the most prominent face of each lid. The design of these pieces allows them, as archival boxes, not to be omitted in a space and now to be present and to be part of the composition of the place. These objects were designed to be developed in 2mm aluminum veneer.</p>
